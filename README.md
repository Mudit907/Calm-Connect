🌿 Calm-Connect — An Intelligent Therapy Recommender for Mental Wellness
Hi Reddit!
I'm excited to share a personal project I’ve been working on called Calm-Connect — a mental wellness platform that blends AI-driven recommendations with traditional and contemporary therapeutic practices.

🧠 What is Calm-Connect?
Calm-Connect is a web-based, mobile-accessible platform designed to support emotional well-being by offering personalized therapy suggestions using machine learning. It acts like a dynamic mental wellness companion that understands your current emotional state and guides you toward the most effective self-care methods.

🎯 Features
🎵 Audio Therapy – calming and therapeutic sounds.

🧘 Yoga & Meditation – breathing exercises, posture guides.

📖 Reading Therapy – bibliotherapy with recommended reads.

😂 Laughter Therapy – mood-lifting laughter sessions.

🙏 Spirituality – mindfulness and spiritual guidance.

🧠 Machine-Learning-Based Recommendation – personalized therapy suggestions using user interaction patterns.

🧑‍💼 Professional Guidance Integration (future scope) – support system for users needing deeper help.

🛠️ Tech Stack
HTML/CSS/JS (Vanilla stack)

Modular structure (audio.js, reading.js, model.html, etc.)

Responsive design for mobile-first users

Focused on privacy-first design — no invasive data capture

🤖 How It Works
The user interacts with different sections (audio, laughter, yoga, spirituality, reading).

Interaction data and context (like age or mood) feed into the therapy recommender module.

The system suggests personalized therapy tracks that adapt as usage continues.

🌍 Why This Matters
Reduces stigma around mental health by providing a private, accessible, and inclusive space.

Designed for teens, adults, and seniors, especially those who may not have access to therapy.

Aligned with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDG 3 – Good Health and Well-being).
